        <h2 class="h2project">Sources</h2>
        <p>I used the Google fonts Playfair Display and Roboto which can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display">here</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">here</a><br>I used CSS grids and flexbox as two major parts of my design, my gallery and navigation<br>
        I referenced <a href="https://codeburst.io/flexbox-building-a-navigation-part-2-2-6cc58b9d4173">this</a> article to start to get an idea of how to impliment my grid with information underneath and set up my page. I then adapted and styled it as needed.<br>
        I got my mockup images from <a href="https://psdrepo.com/free-psd/white-clay-mockups-collection-freebie/">here</a> , <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/search?q=mockups">here</a> and <a href="https://www.mockupworld.co/?s=macbook+notebook&download_category=&submit=Search">here</a></p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Challenges</h2>
        <p>I had not coded for quite a while before this so getting into the swing of things once again was rather difficult. I had never used CSS grids before, I had mainly used floats and flex-box sometimes so once I wrapped my head around that and saw its power I was all good. I did struggle with the printable CSS media query too but I eventually understood it as I have never approached coding something in that way. </p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Beyond</h2>
        <p>I enjoyed styling many hover states on both the navigation and in the gallery. It was very interesting to see how difficult it was t style the drop shadow just right to appear as if material while on a screen, as well as tuning the transition times for the scale up to be just right. Content wise, condensiong my information into a structured template was a challenge for some unique projects and made me think about them more. Overall maintaining a cohesive design style and feel with whitespace, color and font was very fun. </p>
