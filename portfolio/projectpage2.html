        <h2 class="h2project">Overview</h2>
        <p>RIT's University News is a site made for RIT students and faculty to obtain the latest news and updates about all thats happening in RIT. The website however is lacking in poor design and therefore appeal to draw viewers in. The main prompt for this project was to re-skin the site to make it a more useable experience. </p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Problem</h2>
        <p>The current design of the university news site has many problems. It has poor hierarchy, the viewer doesn't know where to look first, so many different fonts and headlines are competing for attention. Absense of whitespace, elements are squished together resulting in a lack of macro and micro whitespace, giving the viewer no place to rest. And there is no defined style, From the social icons to numerous different typefaces being used, there is no consistent design </p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Solution</h2>
        <p>I approached re-designing the site by keeping the original problems I noticed in mind and focused directly on fixing them. For the feature story, though in the original design the feature story was prominent, including a large picture and title, focus was drawn away from it due to the clutter of information all around it. In my re-design I wanted it to be a focus, what the viewer sees as soon as they enter the site. For the story and upcoming event cards instead of having the event info in a single column with tons of text loosely ties to a graphic, I grouped the events into cards that provided information to the viewer more efficiently and in a scannable manner.For the style, by creating a defined style utilizing consistent type, color, and graphics the site became more approachable. I chose to stay true to RIT branding in order to have some kind of structure to follow with my design, as well as to make the site re-skin as realistic as possible. </p>
