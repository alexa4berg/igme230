        <h2 class="h2project">Overview</h2>
        <p>The DMV isn’t everyone’s favorite place, the goal of this project was to change that. I was to design a new interactive web based experience for the standard Vehicle Registration application, starting off with the DMV’s MV-82 form. </p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Problem</h2>
        <p>The DMV's current paper form is very outdated, it's riddled with many problems obvious at first glance.As most printed forms do, the design feels very outdated. The use of blue, grey, and back for separation causes a strain on viewers. Though there is an attempt to chunk the elements together, the groups are packed very tightly together causing the form to be difficult to read. The form is full of automotive jargon that the design assumes users are familiar with to be able to answer in depth questions. The form fails when users aren't able to answer with important information correctly. </p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Solution</h2>
        <p>Switching form a paper to web format allows for the ability to bring ease to the user and focus to the design
            A web based format allowed me to make the experience of completing a form more enjoyable through interaction, type, color, human centered wording and graphics, shattering the DMV stereotype of being a place where souls go cold. Improved design was approachable and accessible for the full range of possible users, from a teenager to the elderly. Codes such as the VIN number and license ID that contained much of the data that the user is being asked to provide, why make users do more work when the technology is there. The design cleaned up by utilizing auto-generating fields, revealing information as needed, helping the viewer to feel less overwhelmed and in control. </p>
