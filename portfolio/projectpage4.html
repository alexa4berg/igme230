        <h2 class="h2project">Overview</h2>
        <p>The focus of this project was to re-design the RIT Reporter site to exercise responsive interactive editorial design muscles. Reporter is a student run publication at Rochester Institute of Technology, The magazine is a daily online publication and a 32 page full-color issue printed on the first Friday of the month for the duration of the academic year.  Aimed primarily toward its main users, RIT students quickly scanning, between classes during busy schedules to learn about events, news, have a fun experience browsing. Using existing content I re-designed the Reporter site to engage more users and grow usership through an elevated design</p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Problem</h2>
        <p>There is an overuse of info cards that all look identical and keep repeating. As a new visiter, only until you get to the footer would you know that this is a student run organization for the RIT community. The site doesnâ€™t give students or members a reason to spend their time on the site instead of other social media </p>
        <h2 class="h2project">Solution</h2>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from sites like Medium, The Outline and platforms like Slack I wanted to elevate the site's design, creating a comfortably modern site with traditional editorial aspects. Make it clear that Reporter is by students for the RIT community, no more hiding in the footer. Create a design that is visually interesting and systematically breaks the grid. Draw off inspiration from social media to create designs like what target users are familiar with and enjoy. Create a unique traditionally modern feel with combination of serif and sans serif fonts.</p>
